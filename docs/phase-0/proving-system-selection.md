# Proving System Selection & Rationale

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of different proving systems for our zkVM implementation, evaluating their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for our specific use case.

## Proving System Candidates

**Weaknesses**:
- **Proof Size**: Relatively larger proof sizes compared to STARKs for certain applications
- **Verification Time**: Can be slower than some alternatives for simple computations
- **Learning Curve**: Complex mathematical foundations require significant expertise

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Proof Size: ~1.5KB for typical circuits
- Proving Time: O(n log n) where n is circuit size
- Verification Time: O(log n) with small constant factors

### 2. Plonky2

**Description**: A SNARK system built on PLONK with optimizations for fast proving and verification.

**Strengths**:
- **Fast Proving**: Optimized for speed with efficient field arithmetic

- Verification Time: Sub-millisecond for most circuits

### 3. STARK-based Systems

**Description**: Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge, providing post-quantum security without trusted setup.

**Strengths**:
- **Post-Quantum Security**: Resistant to quantum computer attacks
- **Transparent Setup**: No trusted setup required
- **Scalability**: Efficient for large computations
- **Simplicity**: Relatively simple mathematical foundations
- **Auditability**: Easier to verify implementation correctness

**Weaknesses**:

- **Verification Overhead**: Higher verification costs, especially for small computations

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Proof Size: 10-100KB depending on security parameters
- Proving Time: O(n log n) with good constant factors
- Verification Time: O(logÂ² n) but with higher constants

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Performance Requirements
- **Proving Time**: Critical for user experience in interactive applications
- **Verification Time**: Important for on-chain verification and validator efficiency
- **Proof Size**: Affects storage and transmission costs

### 2. Security Considerations
- **Cryptographic Assumptions**: Preference for well-established assumptions
- **Quantum Resistance**: Future-proofing against quantum attacks
- **Trusted Setup**: Avoiding trusted setup reduces attack surface

### 3. Implementation Complexity
- **Developer Experience**: Availability of tools, documentation, and examples
- **Maintenance Burden**: Long-term sustainability and community support
- **Integration Effort**: Ease of integration with existing systems

### 4. Use Case Alignment
- **zkVM Requirements**: Specific needs for virtual machine implementation
- **Scalability Needs**: Expected computation sizes and throughput
- **Deployment Context**: Target environments (blockchain, standalone, etc.)

## Recommendation: Halo 2

After careful evaluation, we recommend **Halo 2** as our proving system for the following reasons:

### Primary Rationale

1. **Maturity and Reliability**: Halo 2 has been extensively tested in production through Zcash, providing confidence in its security and stability.

2. **No Trusted Setup**: Eliminates the security risks and complexity associated with trusted setup ceremonies.

3. **Recursive Composition**: Essential for zkVM applications where we need to compose proofs across multiple execution steps.

4. **Balanced Performance**: While not the fastest in every metric, it provides good overall performance characteristics suitable for our use case.

5. **Ecosystem Support**: Strong documentation, active community, and availability of libraries and tools.

### Trade-offs Accepted

- **Proof Size**: Larger than Plonky2 but acceptable for our use case
- **Verification Time**: Slower than Plonky2 but fast enough for practical applications
- **Complexity**: Mathematical complexity is manageable with proper team training

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Begin with basic Halo 2 implementation for core zkVM functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Optimize circuit design and custom gates for performance
3. **Phase 3**: Implement recursive proof composition for complex programs
4. **Future**: Monitor developments in Plonky2 and STARK systems for potential migration

## Alternative Considerations

### Fallback Option: Plonky2
If Halo 2 proves insufficient for performance requirements, Plonky2 offers:
- Superior proving speed
- Smaller proof sizes
- Modern optimizations

### Long-term Consideration: STARK-based Systems
For future quantum-resistant requirements:
- Post-quantum security
- Transparent setup
- Simplified security analysis

## Conclusion

Halo 2 provides the best balance of security, performance, and ecosystem maturity for our zkVM implementation. Its proven track record and comprehensive feature set make it the optimal choice for Phase 0 development while maintaining flexibility for future optimizations or system migrations.
